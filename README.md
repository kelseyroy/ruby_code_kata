# ruby_code_kata

## Functional Requirements

Perform one of the following code katas in front of the mentoring team.

* [FizzBuzz Kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/)
* [Game of Nim Kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Nim/)
* [Prime Factors Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/prime-factors)
* [Roman Numerals Kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/)

## Implementation Requirements

* Complete the problems using Ruby within Vim
* Complete the kata in under ten minutes (under five minutes if you are especially well practiced).
* Use the best TDD technique possible and build up the feature in small steps.

## Resources

* YouTube has many great videos on people demoing these katas from start to finish.

## Evaluation

Here are a few example indicators that help you tell if an apprentice has successfully completed this project:

* They can complete the kata, start to finish, in under ten minutes.
* They use good TDD technique, commiting to the red/green/refactor cycle.
* They do not take large leaps in logic.
* They do not rewrite large sections of code, all at once.
